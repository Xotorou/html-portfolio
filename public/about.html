<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Jeremy, also known online as Xotorou, a creator, educator, and
  lifelong learner who loves building things that bring people together.
</p>

<p>
  My background blends creativity and technology. I’ve worked as a teacher in
  animation, robotics, and game design, where I focused on making complex ideas
  approachable and fun. That same mindset carries into everything I do today,
  whether I’m learning software engineering, creating content, or building
  community spaces.
</p>

<p>
  I’m passionate about games, storytelling, and digital art, and I run a
  gaming-focused community where I stream, collaborate, and share experiences
  with others. I enjoy exploring how creativity and technical skills intersect,
  from editing videos and designing visuals to learning programming and building
  projects on the web.
</p>

<p>
  At my core, I care about growth, curiosity, and connection. I like helping
  people, learning new skills, and turning ideas into real things. Whether I’m
  working on a new project, improving my craft, or experimenting with code, I’m
  always aiming to level up and create meaningful experiences.
