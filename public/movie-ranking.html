<h3>One Piece Movie 6</h3>
<p>
  The animation was gorgeous and the feelings of each characters were really
  well established
</p>

<h3>Rush Hours</h3>
<p>
  This movie makes me laugh so much, I love seeing Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker
  being silly.

<h3>Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children</h3>
<p>
  Watching my favorite game come to life was breathtaking and seeing them in a
  whole perspective was amazing.
